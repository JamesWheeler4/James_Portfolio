## [Project 5: Track and Field Scouting Tool](https://github.com/JamesWheeler4/James_Portfolio/tree/main/Proj_5%20Track%20and%20Field%20Scouting)
The goal of this project is to collect and explore high school track and field data using Python. Packages used with this project include: pandas, numpy, scipy, selenium, SQLite3, plotly, as well as datetime, time, re, and csv. While discussing the project with the stakeholder, they were curious about the correlations between events. As in, does a fast mark in the 100 meter influence how well the athlete will pole vault? They asked to view these correlations from a macro level then drill down to see rough comparisons between states within their recruiting sphere. The initial reports can be found in section 4 of Analysis within this project.

## [Project 4: Exploring Covid Data with SQL](https://github.com/JamesWheeler4/James_Portfolio/tree/main/Proj_4%20Exploring%20Covid%20data%20with%20SQL) (Plan to revisit)
The goal of this project was to use SQL to gain understanding of what Covid was doing on a global scale. Working with large and evolving data sets would return different results over time and I was interested in viewing a more unfiltered set of Covid data.

## [Project 3: Harvest Project](https://github.com/JamesWheeler4/James_Portfolio/tree/main/Proj_3%20Harvest%20tracking%20tool)
The goal of this project was to create a product that will allow farmers to track multiple metrics with ease. My plan is to construct a relational database with MySQL that will flow into a Tableau dashboard. Though not currently part of this project, I am formatting the database to allow simple data entry by employees in different roles.

## [Project 2: Revising Project 1 with Python and Tableau](https://github.com/JamesWheeler4/James_Portfolio/tree/main/Proj_2%20Revisit%20Bellabeat%20with%20Python%20and%20Tableau)
Having a foundation in R, moving to Python was not too challenging. Also having completed a project already, it was much easier to plan the trajectory of my data processing.

## [Project 1: Case study for Bellabeat](https://github.com/JamesWheeler4/James_Portfolio/tree/main/Proj_1%20Case%20study%20for%20Bellabeat)
As a final project for completing the Google Data Analytics Certificate, I was tasked with completing a case study. Having history within the fitness industry I chose to work with Bellabeat, a wellness company focused on fitness wearables. The project went as follows.
