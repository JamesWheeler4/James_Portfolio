## Project 1: Case study for Bellabeat
As a final project for completing the Google Data Analytics Certificate, I was tasked with completing a case study. Having history within the fitness industry I chose to work with Bellabeat, a wellness company focused on fitness wearables. The project went as follows.

1. I was given a list of tasks to complete, requests from my primary stakeholders, and a data set to use. I condensed all of the given information into a mock *[Project Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ToHGRn7pGlIVNgqHWGRJtbXiU3p2nxm36pNbNm4VwLQ/edit?usp=sharing)*.
2. Moving the dataset into Rstudio where I processed and started to look into the data. The notebook of my journey through the data can be found in this *[Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/jameswheelerda/bellabeat-capstone-080321)*. Summatively, I found correlations between time spent sleeping and time sedentary as well as a distribution of when the participants were most active and the corresponding activity intensity.
3. The deliverable that I completed for this project was in the form of a *[Google slides presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17OLot-w2_zf2OD6mtz9Lg54_LiBtoin-LBGneXZw2ck/edit?usp=sharinghttps://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17OLot-w2_zf2OD6mtz9Lg54_LiBtoin-LBGneXZw2ck/edit?usp=sharing)*. In this presentation I briefly explain the business tasks and the dataset used, being sure to mention some of the context of the dataset. Next, I used visualizations and talking points to explain my findings. Finally I concluded with a summary and suggestions for Bellabeats moving forward.
4. Here is an example of the final visualization that I used to explain when the participants were most active. The colors were pulled directly from the Bellabeats website.

This project, being my first, held a lot of learning lessons. I was proud of the end product but not so much the process in which I got there. To remedy this, I chose to redo the processing and analysis portion of the project with Python and Tableau.

## Project 2: Revising Project 1 with Python and Tableau
Having a foundation in R, moving to Python was not too challening. Also having completed a project already, it was much easier to plan the trajectory of my data processing.
1. I started in Jupyter Notebooks by setting up my environment. I then uploaded, organized, and cleaned my data. Using Seaborn, I used pairplots and heatmaps to prospect for connections within my data. This entire process can be seen in this *[notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/jameswheelerda/bellabeatv2-083021)*.


* Created a tool that estimates data science salaries to help data scientists nefortiate thieri incomes.

* images aren't going to be in a repository
* Need to create special image folder, attached them to another README.md so that they can be linked to this page
* Seems like images can be diplayed with the images and the name but I'm not sure

 This mans suggests the more projects the better! It seems like I will need to get going on some more projects.
* I am hopeful that some of my leads will soon be effective!
## Using built in themes
* You can choose the theme to use in the pages (settings) page.
