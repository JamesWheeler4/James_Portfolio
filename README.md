## Project 1: Case study for Bellabeat
As a final project for completing the Google Data Analytics Certificate, I was tasked with completing a case study. Having history within the fitness industry I chose to work with Bellabeat, a wellness company focused on fitness wearables. The project went as follows.

1. I was given a list of tasks to complete, requests from my primary stakeholders, and a data set to use. I condensed all of the given information into a mock *[project proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ToHGRn7pGlIVNgqHWGRJtbXiU3p2nxm36pNbNm4VwLQ/edit?usp=sharing)*.
2. Moving the dataset into Rstudio where I processed and started to look into the data. The notebook of my journey through the data can be found in this *[notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/jameswheelerda/bellabeat-capstone-080321)*. Summatively, I found correlations between time spent sleeping and time sedentary as well as a distribution of when the participants were most active and the corresponding activity intensity.
3. The deliverable that I completed for this project was in the form of a *[Google slides presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17OLot-w2_zf2OD6mtz9Lg54_LiBtoin-LBGneXZw2ck/edit?usp=sharinghttps://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17OLot-w2_zf2OD6mtz9Lg54_LiBtoin-LBGneXZw2ck/edit?usp=sharing)*. In this presentation I briefly explain the business tasks and the dataset used, being sure to mention some of the context of the dataset. Next, I used visualizations and talking points to explain my findings. Finally I concluded with a summary and suggestions for Bellabeats moving forward.

This project, being my first, held a lot of learning lessons. I was proud of the end product but not so much the process in which I got there. To remedy this, I chose to redo the processing and analysis portion of the project with Python and Tableau.

## Project 2: Revising Project 1 with Python and Tableau
Having a foundation in R, moving to Python was not too challenging. Also having completed a project already, it was much easier to plan the trajectory of my data processing.

1. I started in Jupyter Notebooks by setting up my environment. I then uploaded, organized, and cleaned my data. Using Seaborn, I used pairplots and heatmaps to prospect for connections within my data. This entire process can be seen in this *[notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/jameswheelerda/bellabeatv2-083021)*.
2. Next I turned to Tableau. After uploading my data, I made multiple graphs depicting the relation of nightly sleep to minutes spent sedentary and in varied levels of activity. Once those were complete I created corresponding correlation coefficients and filter sets. I added in total steps relative to nightly sleep as well. Finally I put it all together in a dashboard that will show the relational change between the data sets. Here is the *[dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/james.wheeler2559/viz/Bellabeat083021/EffectsofSleeponDailyMovement_1)*.

Having worked with this data before, the goal of this project was to see if I could find and present the same findings in a more professional way. I am proud of the end product, it has given me inspiration for project 3.

## Project 3: (Current) SQL, Tableau, and Geographical Data
My plan for this project is to work with SQL and navigate through larger data sets before constructing a dashboard to show my information. I would like to work with geographical data in this project.
