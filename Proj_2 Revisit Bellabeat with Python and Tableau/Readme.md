## Project 2: Revising Project 1 with Python and Tableau
Having a foundation in R, moving to Python was not too challenging. Also having completed a project already, it was much easier to plan the trajectory of my data processing.

1. I started in Jupyter Notebooks by setting up my environment. I then uploaded, organized, and cleaned my data. Using Seaborn, I used pairplots and heatmaps to prospect for connections within my data. This entire process can be seen in this *[notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/jameswheelerda/bellabeatv2-083021)*.
2. Next I turned to Tableau. After uploading my data, I made multiple graphs depicting the relation of nightly sleep to minutes spent sedentary and in varied levels of activity. Once those were complete I created corresponding correlation coefficients and filter sets. I added in total steps relative to nightly sleep as well. Finally I put it all together in a dashboard that will show the relational change between the data sets. Here is the *[dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/james.wheeler2559/viz/Bellabeat083021/EffectsofSleeponDailyMovement_1)*.

Having worked with this data before, the goal of this project was to see if I could find and present the same findings in a more professional way. I am proud of the end product, it has given me inspiration for project 3.
