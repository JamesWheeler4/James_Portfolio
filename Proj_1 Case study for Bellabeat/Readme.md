## Project 1: Case study for Bellabeat
As a final project for completing the Google Data Analytics Certificate, I was tasked with completing a case study. Having history within the fitness industry I chose to work with Bellabeat, a wellness company focused on fitness wearables. The project went as follows.

1. I was given a list of tasks to complete, requests from my primary stakeholders, and a data set to use. I condensed all of the given information into a mock *[project proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ToHGRn7pGlIVNgqHWGRJtbXiU3p2nxm36pNbNm4VwLQ/edit?usp=sharing)*.
2. Moving the dataset into Rstudio where I processed and started to look into the data. The notebook of my journey through the data can be found in this *[notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/jameswheelerda/bellabeat-capstone-080321)*. Summatively, I found correlations between time spent sleeping and time sedentary as well as a distribution of when the participants were most active and the corresponding activity intensity.
3. The deliverable that I completed for this project was in the form of a *[Google slides presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17OLot-w2_zf2OD6mtz9Lg54_LiBtoin-LBGneXZw2ck/edit?usp=sharinghttps://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17OLot-w2_zf2OD6mtz9Lg54_LiBtoin-LBGneXZw2ck/edit?usp=sharing)*. In this presentation I briefly explain the business tasks and the dataset used, being sure to mention some of the context of the dataset. Next, I used visualizations and talking points to explain my findings. Finally I concluded with a summary and suggestions for Bellabeats moving forward.

This project, being my first, held a lot of learning lessons. I was proud of the end product but not so much the process in which I got there. To remedy this, I chose to redo the processing and analysis portion of the project with Python and Tableau.
